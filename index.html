<h1> ONE PERCENT BETTER </h1>

<p>We all want to get better at something in life.</p>

<p>[Why aiming for consistency is more important than anything else]</p>

<p>The One Percent Better Method is to breakdown the most important aspects of your life and then do something everyday to focussed on that aspect.</p>

<p>There are three main pillars to this approach:

<ol>

  <li><h4>Take care of your top 3 to do list everyday</h4></li>
    <p>Often we can spend the whole day working and taking care of the urgent but insignificant tasks. Listing your top 3 to do list for the day helps you take a long term view when deciding what to do (hint: most important tasks are those which one completed will start compounding), explicitly know what needs to be done thorough out the day and stay accountable to yourself.</p>
    <p>Once you know what needs to be done, think how you can increase the probability of you achieving this.</p>

  <li><h4>Develop the supporting muscles</h4></li>
    <p>Your brain, body and mental state are like supporting muscles., which need to nurtured regularly. How resilient you are in life will depend on how strong these muscles are. The One Percent Journal Method breaks down your life in the following areas:</p>
      <ol>
          <li><b>Body</b>: Do something that is good for your body - exercise, eat better, sleep better etc.</li>
          <li><b>Brain</b>: Do something outside of work that engages your brain. It could be learning a new skill</li>
          <li><b>Happiness</b>: Do something that makes you happy or increases your energy level</li>
          <li><b>Perseverance</b>: Do one thing that makes you push yourself a bit.</li>
          <li><b>Sleep</b>: Make sure you sleep quality is good. Actively take steps if it's not.</li>
      </ol>

  <li><h4>Give yourself feedback</h4></li>
    <p>Reinforce the positive and change the negatives. Write about one thing that you did really well specially it was different than how would have reacted otherwise. Then write one thing that you wished you would have done differently. Looking at yourself from a third person perspective allows you to observe and acknowledge things, which other wise would go unnoticed.</p>

  </ol>
